# Arch live ISO creation with docker

This is just a stupid script (less than 100 lines) to run this process automaticaly. Very simple, maybe someday will do a bit more.

## Quick start

To create the ISO, you only have to have docker installed and run:

```
./build-iso.sh
```

The ISO will be placed in ```archlive/out```.
